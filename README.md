# Text File Processing and Analysis Repository

This repository contains a collection of R scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed to facilitate the processing, analysis, and modeling of text data stored in CSV format. The primary functionalities include:

    Text File Generation: Scripts for converting a CSV dataset into individual text files, organized based on properties such as date and valence. This allows for a structured and chronological arrangement of text data, aiding in subsequent analyses.

    Text Analysis with SpeechGraphs: Utilize the SpeechGraphs software to perform detailed analysis on the generated text files. SpeechGraphs is a powerful tool for visualizing and interpreting speech patterns, providing valuable insights into the structure and characteristics of the text.

    Bootstrapped Generalized Linear Model (GLM): Implement a bootstrapped GLM to perform robust statistical analysis on the groups of text files. This approach ensures the reliability and validity of the statistical inferences drawn from the data.

    SQL-Python Interface: Integrate SQL with Python to manage and query large datasets efficiently. This interface supports  data retrieval and manipulation, enhancing the overall workflow from data extraction to analysis.

This repository is ideal for researchers and data scientists interested in text analysis, speech pattern recognition, and robust statistical modeling. It combines the strengths of R, Python, and SQL to provide a comprehensive toolkit for text data processing and analysis.
